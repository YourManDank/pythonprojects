# When performing mathematical operations, each operation is ideally put within it's own print() function so thay Python can recognise them:
print(27+73)
print(214-114)

# Any operation that involves division will always give a float as the result:
print(400/4)
print(20*5)

# Any operation that uses a flaot will give a float as the result:
print(2.5-0.5)

# You can assign multiple variables on the same line:
a, b, c = 1 , 2 ,3

# To create a constant, simply write a variable ALL IN CAPS:
MAX_CONNECTIONS: 1000

# Add underscores to large numbers in order to make them more legibile; Python skip over reading the underscores and not print them:
print(15_000_000_000)

favourte_number = 10
print(favourte_number)
